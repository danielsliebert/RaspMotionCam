# RaspMotionCam
Our team created a motion-detecting surveillance device using a camera module attached to a Raspberry Pi. When motion is detected a script runs which uploads the current date and time to a cloud database. On our website, these times are pulled from the database and can be viewed to see trends in movement activity.
